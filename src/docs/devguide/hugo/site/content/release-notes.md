This page describes changes to the Airtime Service Interface implemented across different releases of the interface.

## v5.11.0

Released 25 February 2019
- The `Product.name` field now allows all characters with only a length limitation. The maximum length limitation has been increased to 40.

## v5.10.0

Released 14 February 2019
- Corrected repetition of API base path.
  - *Note* This is breaking change to the API but is not treated as such. Previously the API defined paths to operations as `/airtime/v5/airtime/v5/{operation}` when they should have been of the more simple form `/airtime/v5/{operation}`. Changing the API base path in this manner would typically be a breaking change and would be reflected as such by bumping the major version number in the URL from `v5` to `v6`. However, all known projects depending on the Airtime Service Interface are already implemented using the simpler base path of `/airtime/v5/{operation}`. Thus the decision was made to transparently fix the base path repetition bug as a minor version update as this was deemed to be a less disruptive change to all known projects.
- Added new ErrorTypes:
  - `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`
  - `INVALID_CARD_NUMBER`
  - `CARD_EXPIRED`
  - `INCORRECT_PIN`

## v5.1.0

Released 5 April 2017

- Aligned with new base service interface version (v3.2.0).
  - Removed restriction on allowed characters from the terminalId property which means it now only has a max and min length restriction of 8.
  - Added an issuerReference property which adds a unique identifier to the customers slip.
  - Added a basketRef property which is used to group multiple transactions which would otherwise be considered independent.

- Breaking changes for provided implementation.
  - Remove incorrect calls to AsyncResponse.resume in resources classes.
  - Updated Airtime Service Interface abstract resource classes. The classes were changed to pass all parameters to the Implementor's custom resource implementation, as opposed to resuming the AsyncResponse from within the resource. The Implementor should now call resume on the AsyncResponse. This allows for more flexibility, proper asynchronicity and allows the user to choose their own threading model.
  - Added Jax RS Core Request to the expected parameters from @Context. This is passed through as above with the rest of the parameters.
  - Changed all advice responses to BasicAdvice from BasicAdviceResponse.
